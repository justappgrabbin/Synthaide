// Pure Synthia Automata — mesh: emergent channels (temporary crossings promote to persistent channels)

/**
 * EmergentChannels — the self-cultivation principle made mechanical. When two
 * automata connect and a packet crosses from one to the other, the connection
 * itself is recorded as a CROSSING. A crossing used once is temporary; a
 * crossing used repeatedly (>= CHANNEL_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD) is promoted to a
 * persistent CHANNEL — functionality neither automaton contains independently:
 * the channel becomes a composite capability {tools:[a,b], compose:
 * 'sequential'} that the learning orchestrator can route requests through.
 *
 * Determinism: no wall-clock; `createdSeq`/`promotedSeq` come from an internal
 * monotone counter, so replaying the same packet history reproduces the same
 * crossings and promotions.
