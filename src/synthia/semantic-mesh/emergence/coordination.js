// Pure Synthia Automata — emergence: MeshCoordinator (synchronized multi-automata runs with packet propagation)

/**
 * MeshCoordinator — ported from
 *   pure-synthia-pass4-step41-REPAIRED/src/emergence/multi-automata.js
 *
 * What the source's AutomataMesh had that OUR mesh (src/mesh/mesh.js) lacks:
 * a COORDINATED RUN pattern — one input is broadcast synchronously to every
 * automaton in the mesh, each produces its own trace, and every successful
 * step propagates a state packet across the automaton's mesh connections
 * (spec §10: an instance belongs simultaneously to multiple meshes,
 * propagating qualified state packets). Our mesh routes individual packets
 * between two automata but never runs the population together; that
 * coordination pattern is what this module ports.
 *
 * Adaptations to our interfaces:
 *   - automata are our Automaton class: run() drives `delta` over
 *     input.symbols (or the tool implementation) and returns
 *     {output, trace, ledger, accepted, finalState}; a throwing automaton
 *     fails ONLY its own trace entry — coordination continues (the source let
 *     one automaton's throw abort the whole mesh run).
 *   - packets are our StatePacket class routed through mesh.route(), so every
 *     coordinated delivery is recorded as a crossing by EmergentChannels —
 *     coordination feeds the channel-promotion stats.
 *   - determinism: packet ids are counter-derived (`coord-pkt-N`); automata
 *     and connections iterate in Map insertion order; no wall-clock (the
 *     source stamped Date.now() on connections).
 *
 * NOT ported (redundant or missing substrate — see docs/MERGE_NOTES.md):
 *   - AutomataMeshRegistry: a name -> mesh map; our engine owns exactly one
 *     AutomataMesh, which already IS the registry of automata.
 *   - collapse() (product-machine composition): the source's AutomataComposer
 *     has no counterpart in this codebase, and our channel promotion
 *     (mesh/channels.js) is the mechanism by which repeated composition
 *     becomes a first-class capability here.
